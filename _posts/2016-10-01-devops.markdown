We have experience of implementing state of the art automation solutions within enterprise organisations. Often requiring automation of:

* Developer workflows
* Testing at Unit, Integration, System
* BDD and ATDD
* Continuous integration stacks
* Continuous deployment stacks
* COTS product automation

In addition to this expertise we have experience of the transitionary pitfalls that can occur when introducing DevOps into the organisation. We have worked with IT Operations, Support Teams, Marketing, Business Operations departments to enact lasting change on the organisation from developers on the ground to the C-Suite.
